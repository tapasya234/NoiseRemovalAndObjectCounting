# NoiseRemovalAndObjectCounting
An Image Processing project.

An image is processed using Gaussian filters, Binary Images, Object Detection, Color Manipulation with the help of OpenCV library.

Part 1: Add Gaussian noise to the original image and remove the noise from the image using my code. The method used is Gaussian Smoothing.

Part 2: Add Salt and Pepper noise to the original image and remove the noise from the image using my code. The method used is Median filtering.

Part 3: Increase the contrast of the image by 50 and save the image.

Part 4: Count the number of apples in all the images using the concepts erosion, dilation and connected components.

Technologies: C++, OpenCV, Image Processing.
